# CS-330-Final-Project-OpenGL-3D

How do I approach designing software?
  Learning how to create shapes in opengl 3d has allowed me to craft unique 3d designs in OpenGL.
  Design proccesses I followed to complete my project was trial and error with trying different xyz coordinates and rotation and size values
  until the design looked nice enough. Tactics from this design approach can be applied in future work through trying different code until the scene looks really good.

How do I approach developing programs?
  New development strategies I used while working on my 3D scene was using trial and error to make sure the code is functioning properly.
  Iteration factored into my development since each assignment each week built upon the original project to make it better.
  This led to a lot of changes throughout development. My approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones.
  I felt more confident in each milestone as the code and software became easier to work on. This led me to finishing the project
  through the new information I learned.

  How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
    Computational graphics and visualization give me new knowledge and skills in problem solving and learning more C++.
    Knowing C++ and these new skills can help me use problem solving skills to do more professional work.
